# Part 6 (YOLO) answers


part6_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**

For the first picture:
1. The model didn't recognize the dolphins present in the image. Instead of it, it detects a bird and a person.
2. The reason for this is that "dolphin" is not a possible class for an object in YoloV3 model. It probably detects a 
bird because of the sky in the background and the black color of the dolphin. The method I would suggest to recognize 
dolphin in the image would be to add some dolphin images to the dataset, a new dolphin class and retrain the model with
it. I would also suggest having some shadow images of dolphins or to add an ability to the model to detect some black 
shadows of objects. (TODO: check with team about black shadow, not sure if it's necessary to talk about it)

For the second picture:
1. The model detected the objects almost right. In right side, it detects two dogs and draw the relevant bounding boxes
around them. In left side, it detects a cat, which is present in the image, but draw the bounding box mainly on the
third dog present left and not around the cat. So it missed the right bounding box around the cat and the detection of
the third dog.
2. I would say that the reason why the models didn't detects well the object on right is because the image is cluttered,
there is a lot of objects and it's difficult for the model to detect each one of them.
(TODO: check this with team too)
